# News application

This application is based on <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com> API.

The application is made using the ReactJS library + TypeScript programming language. The following tools were used: AXIOS for API requests, React Router for routing the application, Redux for managing the state of the application and its requests, Redux Persist for saving data in Local Storage, React Hook Form for building and validating the form. The MUI component library was also used for the UI.

Implemented: initial page, a page with a list of articles that are loaded from the API, an article component, a form for adding soy articles (with validation), adding articles to favorites and a page with these articles, buttons for calling the form and scrolling the page to the top. "Infinite Loader" is also implemented.
